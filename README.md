# About SoftRepo
This is a software repository for my YouTube channel, which you can find by simply typing "Wind/owZ" to YouTube's material design search box with a keyboard attached to the computer or a virtual keyboard installed on the mobile device. You can access here either by searching for it in GitHub's search box (...) or clicking on the link I'm putting on my videos' description using a mouse attached to the devuce/tapping on it using a finger.
