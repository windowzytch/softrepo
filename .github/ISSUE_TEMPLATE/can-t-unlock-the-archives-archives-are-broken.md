Please confirm that you did these (Put double slashes after each line if you did so.);
/ Used an external archiving program (Such as WinRAR) to try extracting the archives.
/ Tried a different archive to extract.
/ Double checked the password.
/ Checked archiver logs to see if something is wrong about the archive.

// If all those are tried but still no luck, attach screenshots about the things seemed broken. //
